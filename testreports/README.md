- **`test-summary.html`**: Quick summary of test results for quick overview

### Coverage Reports
- **`coverage/`**: Directory containing code coverage reports
  - **`index.html`**: Main coverage report
  - **`lcov-report/`**: LCOV format coverage report
  - **`coverage-final.json`**: JSON coverage data

### Data Files
- **`test-results.json`**: Machine-readable test results for CI/CD integration

## 🚀 Generating Reports

### Run All Tests with Reports
```bash
cd tests
npm run test:report
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:unit -- --coverage

# Integration tests with coverage
npm run test:integration -- --coverage

# All tests with detailed reporting
npm run test:all -- --coverage --coverageReporters=html
```

## 📈 Understanding Reports

### Test Report Structure
- **Summary Cards**: Overview of test results (total, passed, failed, skipped, duration, success rate)
- **Categorized Results**: Tests organized by type (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security, ui, smoke)
- **Detailed Information**: Individual test results with failure messages and execution times
- **Coverage Metrics**: Code coverage statistics and visual indicators

### Coverage Metrics
- **Statements**: Percentage of code statements executed
- **Branches**: Percentage of code branches (if/else, switch cases) executed
- **Functions**: Percentage of functions called
- **Lines**: Percentage of code lines executed

### Success Criteria
- **Green**: All tests passed
- **Red**: Some tests failed
- **Yellow**: Some tests skipped
- **Gray**: Tests pending or not run

## 🔍 Report Features

### Interactive Elements
- **Tabbed Interface**: Switch between different test categories
- **Expandable Details**: Click on failed tests to see error details
- **Search and Filter**: Find specific tests or results
- **Export Options**: Download reports in various formats

### Visual Indicators
- **Color Coding**: Green for passed, red for failed, yellow for skipped
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of coverage percentages
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visual representation of test metrics
- **Timeline**: Test execution timeline and duration

## 📱 Responsive Design

Reports are designed to be viewable on:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured interface with all details
- **Tablet**: Optimized layout for medium screens
- **Mobile**: Simplified view for small screens

## 🔧 Customization

### Report Configuration
Reports can be customized by modifying:
- **`tests/reporters/html-reporter.js`**: Main HTML report generator
- **`tests/reporters/custom-reporter.js`**: Custom reporter configuration
- **`tests/package.json`**: Jest configuration and scripts

### Adding Custom Metrics
To add custom metrics to reports:
1. Modify the reporter files
2. Add new data collection in test setup
3. Update the HTML templates
4. Configure Jest to use custom reporters

## 📊 CI/CD Integration

### Automated Reporting
Reports are automatically generated in CI/CD pipelines:
- **GitHub Actions**: Reports uploaded as artifacts
- **Jenkins**: Reports published to build pages
- **GitLab CI**: Reports integrated with merge requests

### Report Archival
- Reports are archived for historical analysis
- Coverage trends tracked over time
- Performance metrics monitored
- Security test results maintained

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Reports Not Generated**: Check Jest configuration and reporter setup
2. **Missing Coverage**: Ensure coverage is enabled in test configuration
3. **Empty Reports**: Verify tests are running and producing results
4. **Format Issues**: Check HTML template and CSS styling

### Debug Steps
1. Check test execution logs
2. Verify reporter configuration
3. Test individual report components
4. Review Jest setup and configuration
